*********************************
The Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol
*********************************

The Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (“CCTP”) defines the communication between the mainchain and sidechain(s). It is a 2-way peg protocol that allows sending coins from Mainchain to a Sidechain, and vice versa.

At a high level, it defines two basic operations:
   
   * **Forward Transfer**
   * **Backward Transfer**
   
While all Sidechains know and follow the Mainchain, which is an established and stable reality, Mainchain needs to be made aware of the existence of every sidechain. So, Sidechains first must be declared in Mainchain.

We can declare a new Sidechain by using the following RPC command:

``sc_create withdrawalEpochLength "address" amount "verification key" "vrfPublickKey" "genSysConstant"``

The command specifies where the first forward transfer coins are sent, as well as the epoch length, that defines the frequency, in blocks, of the backward transfers submissions (see the “backward transfers” paragraph below). The sc_create command also includes the cryptographic key to receive coins back from a Sidechain. The verification key guarantees that the received coins were processed according to a matching proving system.
As a consequence of the sidechain declaration command, a unique sidechain id will be assigned to that sidechain, that from that moment on can be used for every operation related to that specific sidechain:

::
   
   {
      "txid": "9e4676274f1ff9b3164de6e0d6492c4dfc1d564b0243a36208c6b7fe848f9d21",
      "scid": "2f7ed2e07ad78e52f43aafb85e242497f5a1da3539ecf37832a0a31ed54072c3",
   }



Forward Transfer
================

A forward transfer sends coins from the mainchain to a sidechain. The Horizen mainchain supports a “Forward Transfer” transaction type, that specifies the sidechain destination (sidechain id and receiver address) and the amounts of ZEN coins to be sent. From a mainchain perspective, the transferred coins are destroyed, they are only represented in the total balance of that particular sidechain.
On the Sidechain side, the SDK provides all the functionalities that support Forward Transfers, so that a transferred amount is “converted” into a new Sidechain Box.

Backward Transfer
=================

A backward transfer moves coins back from a sidechain to a mainchain destination.
A Backward Transfer is initiated by a **Withdrawal Request** which is a sidechain transaction issued by the coin owners. The request specifies the mainchain destination, and the amount. More precisely, the withdrawal request owner will create a WithdrawalRequestBox that destroys the specified amount of coins in a sidechain. This is not enough to move those coins back to the mainchain though: we need to wait the end of the withdrawal epoch, when all the coins specified in that epoch’s Withdrawal Requests are listed in a single Certificate, that is the propagated to the Mainchain.
The Certificate includes a succinct cryptographic proof that the rules associated with the declared verifying key have been respected. Certificates are processed by Mainchain consensus, which recreates the coins as specified by the certificate, only checking that the proof verifies, and that the coins received by a sidechain are not  more than the amount sent to it.

Summary
=======

The Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol assumes that proofs are generated with a specific proving system, but does not limit the logic of the computation that is proven by the proving system (the “circuit”). So, sidechain developers could implement the proving system that they want and need, to prove the legitimacy of backward transfers. The examples provided with the SDK implement a sample proving system, that proves that the certificate was signed by a minimum number of certifiers, whose key identities were declared at sidechain creation time. This is just a demo circuit; production sidechains require robust circuits (see the Latus recursive model in the Zendoo paper).
