The pages in this section of the documentation are aimed at the newcomer to
the Sidechain-SDK. They're designed to help you get started quickly, and show how
easy it is to work with the Sidechain SDK as a developer who wants to customise it and
get it working according to their own requirements.

These tutorials take you step-by-step through some key aspects of this work.
They're not intended to explain the :doc:`topics in depth </topics/index>`, or
provide :doc:`reference material </reference/index>`, but they will leave you
with a good idea of what is possible to achieve in just a few steps, and how
to go about it.

Once you're familiar with the basics presented in these tutorials, you'll find
the more in-depth coverage of the same topics in the :doc:`How-to
</how_to/index>` section.

The tutorials follow a logical progression, starting from installation of Horizen Sidechain SDK and the
creation of a brand new project, and build on each other, so it's recommended to work through them
in the order presented here.
